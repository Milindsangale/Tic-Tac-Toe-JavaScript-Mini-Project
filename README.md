## ðŸ“œ About the Project  
 A Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a classic beginner-friendly project that helps solidify fundamental web development concepts. Here's a project description outlining the key features.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: For structuring the game's layout, including the game board and other elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the game, making it visually appealing, and controlling the appearance of the board, pieces, and messages.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, handling user interactions (clicks), determining the winner, and managing the game state.

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid displayed on the webpage.  Each cell in the grid should be clickable.
- **Player Turns**: Two players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their respective markers ("X" or "O").
- **Marker Placement**: When a player clicks an empty cell, their marker ("X" or "O") is displayed in that cell.
- **Win Detection**: The game logic checks for a winning combination (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) after each move.
- **Draw Condition**: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
- **Game Over**: Once a player wins or a draw occurs, the game ends, and a message is displayed indicating the result (e.g., "Player X wins!", "Player O wins!", or "It's a draw!").
- **Reset Button**: A button that allows players to reset the game and start a new round.
